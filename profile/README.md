# Mix & Match Machine Learning toolkit
Welcome to the GitHub repository of the Mix & Match ML toolkit!

The Mix & Match ML toolkit is a toolkit that provides relevant ML knowledge to designers/ design students in order to support them when learning about ML or envision ML-enabled solutions.
The toolkit is a hybrid toolkit and consists of a set of tangible tokens, a sensing board and a web interface. The tangible tokens represent different data types and ML capabilities, which together showcase the capabilities and limitations of ML.
Leveraging the physical constraints of the tokens, the relationship between the type of data, i.e. labeled or unlabeled, and the type of ML that the ML capability is using, i.e. supervised, unsupervised or reinforcement, is communicated to the user.

By placing the tokens on the sensing board, the corresponding pages in the web interface will be opened. You can either look at individual tokens or combinations.

## Web interface
[Click here to go to the web interface.](https://mixmatchmltoolkit.github.io/)
<!--

-->
The web interface can also be used without a toolkit. In that case you can press 'skip connection' and use the menu in the top right.

## Open source toolkit
We make all the required files needed for making your own set of tokens and sensing board open source, together with instructions. The code for the web interface can also be found in this repository, and if needed personalized.
However, when no changes are needed you can make your own sensing board and connect it to the web interface that is already online.


### Instructions
Instructions and files for making your own toolkit can be found [here](https://github.com/MixMatchMLtoolkit/DIY-toolkit)


## Version used in TEI paper 2022
The Mix & Match ML toolkit has been updated after the studies presented in the TEI paper. The version of the webinterface used in the two research studies can still be found [here](https://mixmatchmltoolkit.github.io/research/) as well the [source code](https://github.com/MixMatchMLtoolkit/MixMatchMLtoolkit.github.io/tree/main/research). 

<b>Summary of changes to the current version (21/11/2022)</b>
<ul>
<li>Option to choose for educational mode or minimal mode (some information collapsed) </li>
<li>Disclaimers on each page that data, models and examples are from the public domain and might contain biases </li>
<li>New images for all data types </li>
<li>Data page layout revised: short explanation with additonal more information </li>
<li>ML capablity  page layout revised: order capabilities & limitations and examples switched </li>
<li>Definition categorize and identify updated to include examples for clarification </li>
<li>Example application Image + Categorize updated from Google Lens to ObsIdentify  </li>
<li>Example application Table + Categorize updated from Spotify to Palmer penguins </li>
<li>Examples applications added for Table + Communicate, Table + Understand and Table + Translate </li>
<li>Addition of a tangible connector token with whiteboard top that can connect two ML capabilties </li>
<li><i>A compare modus for the sensing board (not yet fully functional, see work in progress)</i> </li>

</ul>

## Work in progess
We are still working on improving toolkit. Currenlty we are working on including/ optimizing the following aspects:
<ul>
<li>Improving the reliablity of the compare modus </li>
<li>Including working example ML models in the web interface</li>
</ul>
