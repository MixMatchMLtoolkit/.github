# Mix & Match Machine Learning toolkit
Welcome to the GitHub repository of the Mix & Match ML toolkit!

The Mix & Match ML toolkit is a toolkit that provides relevant ML knowledge to designers/ design students in order to support them when learning about ML or envision ML-enabled solutions.
The toolkit is a hybrid toolkit and consists of a set of tangible tokens, a sensing board and a web interface. The tangible tokens represent different data types and ML capabilities, which together showcase the capabilities and limitations of ML.
Leveraging the physical constraints of the tokens, the relationship between the type of data, i.e. labeled or unlabeled, and the type of ML that the ML capability is using, i.e. supervised, unsupervised or reinforcement, is communicated to the user.

By placing the tokens on the sensing board, the corresponding pages in the web interface will be opened. You can either look at individual tokens or combinations.

## Open source toolkit
We make all the required files needed for making your own set of tokens and sensing board open source, together with instructions. The code for the web interface can also be found in this repository, and if needed personalized.
However, when no changes are needed you can make your own sensing board and connect it to the web interface that is already online.

When making the toolkit....
