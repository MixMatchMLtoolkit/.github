# Mix & Match Machine Learning toolkit
Welcome to the GitHub repository of the Mix & Match ML toolkit!

The Mix & Match ML toolkit is a toolkit that provides relevant ML knowledge to designers/design students to help them both learn about ML and envision ML-enabled solutions. This hybrid toolkit consists of a set of tangible tokens, a sensing board or mobile web application and a web interface. The tangible tokens represent different data types and ML capabilities, which together showcase the potential and limitations of ML. Through the physical constraints of the tokens, the user understands the relationships between the different types of data, i.e. labeled and unlabeled, and the learning approaches underlying each capability, i.e. supervised, unsupervised or reinforcement learning. 
The physical constraints of the tokens guide the user in understanding what types of training data (labeled or unlabeled) can be used with each ML capability, depending on its underlying learning approach (supervised, unsupervised or reinforcement learning).

To read the tokens, you can either place them on the sensing board or scan them using our mobile web application. This will open their corresponding pages in the web interface will be opened. You can either look at individual tokens or combinations.

> [!TIP]
> Using and making the Mix & Match ML toolkit has become a lot easier! You can now create your own tokens by simply printing them and using your mobile to scan them. See below for more information.

## Web interface
[Click here to go to the web interface.](https://mixmatchmltoolkit.github.io/)

-->
The web interface can also be used without a toolkit. You can choose to either select "skip connection" and navigate using the menu or you can use for example printed tokens and select "connect your phone".

## Open source toolkit
All the required files needed to make your own set of tokens and sensing board are open source. You can find instructions on how to build your Mix&Match ML toolkit below. The code for the web interface is also open source and can be found in this repository. That means you can personalize the contents and examples in the toolkit. When no changes are needed to the code, you can just make your own sensing board and connect it to the web interface that is already online.

### Instructions
Instructions and files for making your own toolkit can be found [here](https://github.com/MixMatchMLtoolkit/DIY-toolkit)

## New update May 2024
We are excited to tell you that it is now also possible to use the Mix & Match ML toolkit with just your phone and a set of tokens. These tokens can be printed, lasercut or simply handwritten on post-its (if you have a readable handwriting)!
The details on how to make these tokens can be found on our [DIY page](https://github.com/MixMatchMLtoolkit/DIY-toolkit). The mobile web application for scanning the tokens can be found [here](https://mix-match-ml.streamlit.app/).


## Version used in TEI paper 2023
